# 🔑 Gmail OAuth App Flow 🔓➡️✉️

An example app to get you started on a google api cli app.

You could very well run this once in order to get your access and refresh token, or you could modify the code a bit and integrate it into your own app.

This example follows the recommendations of **'Option 2: Loopback IP address (macOS, Linux, Windows desktop)'** listed on [OAuth 2.0 for Mobile & Desktop Apps](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2InstalledApp)

`[OAuth Flow] ---> [Loopback Redirect URI] ---> [Fetch Credentials] ---> [Output to Stdout]`


## Install

- Follow the [Prerequisites](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2InstalledApp#prerequisites) on googles developer portal.

- **Download the credentials from 'Prerequisites' instructions into `gmail-app-oauth-flow` root directory as `.config.json`**

## Run

- Run `node main.js > .tokens.json` 

- A browser window prompting you for an google auth flow (should) will pop-up
